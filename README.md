### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description

In this project, I make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States, Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

I use data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.

I write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used

- Python script: bikeshare.py

- The city dataset:
  - chicago.csv
  - new_york_city.csv
  - washington.csv
