### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States, Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

I use data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.

I write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

This project provides the following information:

**#1 Popular times of travel** (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

**#2 Popular stations and trip**
- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

**#3 Trip duration**
- total travel time
- average travel time

**#4 User info**
- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
